/**
 * Bridge helpers used by the legacy webui (`src/ui/server.ts`) to drive
 * the bus runtime's claude session instead of spawning a sidecar PTY.
 *
 * Pulled out of `src/commands/start.ts` so it can be unit-tested
 * without booting the full daemon.
 *
 * Routes consuming this:
 *   - `/api/jobs/fire` — injects a runner into `fireJob` that calls
 *     `streamBusPrompt` with no `onChunk` and returns the accumulated
 *     final reply.
 *   - `/api/inject` — same shape, defaulting the agent to
 *     `BusWebUiBridge.defaultAgentId`.
 *   - `/api/chat` — passes `onChunk` so each `response.text` event is
 *     streamed back to the dashboard SSE as it arrives. Resolves
 *     when `intent: "final"` lands or the timeout fires.
 *
 * Receipt chain (issue #207): every call opens a receipt at entry, stamps
 * `route_resolved` + `prompt_hash` immediately, and closes on the terminal
 * state (`turn_observed` on final, `timeout` on timer, `wedged_prompt` on
 * `bus.sendPrompt` rejection). The bus → PTY seam in `runtime-mount.ts`
 * back-fills `process_pid`/`process_generation`/`agent_cwd` + stamps
 * `stdin_written` via `findByPromptHash`. Receipts land at
 * `~/.claude/claudeclaw/receipts.jsonl` (0600).

/**
 * Per-agent mutex tail used to serialize `streamBusPrompt` calls. Codex
 * P1 on #136: the bus subscriber filter `{agent_id, topics:
 * ["response.text"]}` doesn't carry a per-prompt correlation id, and
 * `BusCore.lastPromptOrigin` is last-write-wins, so two prompts in
 * flight on the same agent can return each other's replies. Serializing
 * at the bridge guarantees at most one prompt awaits per agent — chat,
 * fire, and inject from the dashboard now queue rather than racing.
 *
 * Tradeoff: a long-running cron job firing through `streamBusPrompt`
 * would block a follow-up chat. Acceptable: BusScheduler doesn't go
 * through this bridge (it dispatches via `bus.sendPrompt` directly and
 * doesn't await), and dashboard interactions are intrinsically
 * single-user. If we ever route scheduler triggers through this
 * bridge, swap the mutex for a per-prompt correlation id propagated
 * from the bus core.
